# Simulating Tidal Interactions
This is a supporting repository for project undertaken during the summer of 2017 by pre-university student interns Michael Thiel and Manuel Brea-Carreras at Haus der Astronomie: point-particle simulations of galaxy colisions with the aim of reproducing observasional data from such collisions. 

Repository contents
-------------------
This repository contains:
- A copy of our report on this project, as well as the LaTex source code.
- The simulation script.
- Parameter files for the examples shown in the report. As of now, the parameters need to be manually introduced in the simulation script by editing the parameter section in the source code.
- Any slides we have created to support a presentation of this project.
