# Simulating Tidal Interactions
This repository contains:
- A copy of our report on this project, as well as the LaTex source code.
- The simulation script.
- Parameter files for the examples shown in the report. As of now, the parameters need to be manually introduced in the simulation script by editing the parameter section in the source code.
- Any slides we have created to support a presentation of this project.

If you have any questions for us or want to contact us for any reason, please do so at poessel@hda-hd.de.
